## 1 Introduction

"Nine Men’s Morris (also known as Mill, Mills, Merels, Merelles, or Merrills) is a strategic board game for two players (similar to Chess or Checkers). It is played on a board that has 24 positions (intersections of lines).
Each of the two players has 9 pieces (tokens or men) that, in turn, are placed on the board on one of the empty 24 line intersections, starting with an empty board. Once all 18 pieces have been placed onto the board, players, again in turn, slide one of their pieces along a board line to an empty adjacent intersection (not diagonally). If a player is able to form a straight row of three pieces along one of the board's lines (i.e. not diagonally), he/she has a “mill” and may remove one of his/her opponent's pieces from the board that is not part of a mill. This can happen either during the initial placing of the pieces onto the board or the subsequent sliding of pieces along the board’s lines. A piece that has been removed from the board cannot be placed again and is “lost” for the corresponding player. Once a player has only three pieces left, he/she may jump (fly or hop) one piece per turn to an empty intersection (and hence does not have to slide a piece along one of the board’s lines).
The objective of the game is to leave the opposing player with fewer than three pieces or no legal moves. Hence, once one of the players has achieved such a situation, he/she wins the game."[1]


General Java coding Standards were used for implementation of this game.



## 2 Execution
###2.1 Condition Of ExecutionAs Java files are normally compiled, files attached in the Appendix are all to be placed in appropriate packages and compiled normally.For execution through Command Line, using:`Java Game`

Also files can be imported to eclipse and other development tools.A shorthand for that is to put files in main package and run through command line:`Javac main/*.java` 

Followed by:

`Java main.Game`

### 2.2 Development Environment
Development tools:

* Eclipse Standard/SDK, Version: Luna Release (4.4.0)
* java version "1.8.0_25"
* Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_25­b17)
* Nano Editor


##Developer Notes:

This game was built as a hobby. No future development is supported by this developer. Please be advised that I do not take responsibility for basically anything. 

Have Fun!
